# Prolog Reagby Game solver

1. Random search
2. Backtracking
3. Some other algorithm (A*, Simulated Annealing)

## TODO:

- [x] Remove excessive methods from files
- [x] See the touchdown point
- [x] Optimize passing (easy field size change)
- [x] Make run file to test and measure all the requests
- [x] Show time meric only (simplify testing)
- [ ] Change region of seeeing
- [ ] Scale the system
- [ ] Add 10 tests
- [ ] Add unslvable test and test with touchdown (0, 0)
